## 🚀 Application Walkthrough
- Just as a refresher, this application takes in any number (whole or decimal) and converts it into their word representation in **currency**.
- Thus, basic currency logic applies; only two decimal places, output will contain currency units, etc.
- This application will only support until **Vigintillion**. That is equals to a number 1 followed by 63 zeros!
- It can also takes in negative numbers.

To use it is super simple,
1. Enter a valid number (whole or decimal) into the input field.
2. Press Submit.
3. Watch as your input is converted to its currency work representation!
